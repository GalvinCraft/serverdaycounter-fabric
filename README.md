Server Day Counter is a mod (designed for servers) to broadcast and show the day of the world, just like you can in singleplayer!

*Designed for servers: This also works for singleplayer*

![Demonstration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GalvinCraft/serverdaycounter-fabric/main/.github/assets/java_rejEa8qfsn.png)

*The day count is shown to you in the chat when you join the server (or world in singleplayer)*

![Demonstration 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GalvinCraft/serverdaycounter-fabric/main/.github/assets/java_1tnD7aL7RP.png)

*The day count is broadcasted to the chat once a new day starts (even in singleplayer)*

# Usage
Use the `/daycount` command and it'll show you the day count!
